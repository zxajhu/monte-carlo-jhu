# monte-carlo-jhu
course materials of monte carlo course taught by Prof. Spall.
I enrolled in this course in the first semester as a graduate student major in financial maths in JHU.
You will learn some practiable methods to simulate the problems in daily life from this class such as how to generate numbers from different distributions, which is really helpful!
